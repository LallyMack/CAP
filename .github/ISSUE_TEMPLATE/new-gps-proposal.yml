        ## ðŸ§­ New Governance Problem Statement (GPS)

        Use this form to propose a new **Governance Problem Statement (GPS)** â€” a document describing a governance problem, ambiguity, or systemic challenge.  
        GPS documents are **problem definitions**, not solutions. CAPs will later address them.
