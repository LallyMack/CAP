        Thank you for contributing to Cardano governance!  
        This form will help you submit a **Cardano Amendment Proposal (CAP)** following the official process.

        ðŸ”Ž **Important Notes:**
        - **CAP numbers** are assigned by editors during triage. Use `?` for the number when drafting.

        - CAPs must address one or more [Governance Problem Statements (GPS)](./GPS-0001.md) if applicable.
