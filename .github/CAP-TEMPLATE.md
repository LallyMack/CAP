## Abstract

A short (~200 word) summary of the proposed constitutional amendment and the governance issue it addresses. This section should concisely describe the motivation for change, the nature of the amendment, and its intended outcome for the Cardano governance system.

## Motivation: Why is this CAP necessary?

Explain the purpose of this amendment and the governance problem it seeks to solve. Reference the linked [Governance Problem Statement (GPS)] if applicable. Clearly outline which stakeholders are impacted (e.g., dReps, SPOs, Constitutional Committee, governance bodies) and how the amendment improves governance outcomes.  

If this CAP modifies or supersedes an existing constitutional article, explain the rationale for doing so.

## Amendment Specification

Provide the **exact text** of the proposed constitutional change or addition. This section is considered the **canonical version** of the amendment if ratified.

Include, where relevant:

- New article text or updated article wording
- Changes to governance parameters
- Definitions of new governance mechanisms or procedures
- Versioning scheme, if applicable

## Rationale: How does this CAP achieve its goals?

Discuss the reasoning behind the proposed amendment and how it addresses the governance issue described in the GPS. Explain:

- Why this solution was chosen over alternatives
- Key considerations or trade-offs involved
- Outcomes from community discussion and review
- Any backward compatibility or transition considerations (if applicable)

## Path to Ratification

### Acceptance Criteria

Define the conditions under which this amendment becomes **Ratified**. These may include:

- Minimum vote thresholds and quorum requirements
- Constitutional Committee approval steps
- Required on-chain or off-chain governance actions
- Compatibility with existing governance procedures

### Implementation Plan

Outline how the amendment will be implemented once ratified. This may include:

- Updating the canonical constitution file (e.g. `constitution/constitution-v1.txt`)
- Executing an on-chain governance action (e.g., via a governance transaction)
- Coordinating off-chain processes (e.g., publication, ecosystem communication)
- Notifying or updating relevant tooling, dApps, or governance participants

## Versioning (Optional)

Describe how this amendment will be versioned or superseded in future governance processes, if applicable.

## References (Optional)

List any relevant documentation, standards, governance decisions, or previous CAPs/GPSs referenced in this proposal.
