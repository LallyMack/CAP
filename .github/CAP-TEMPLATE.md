## Abstract

A short (~200 words) summary of the proposed constitutional amendment and the governance issue it addresses.  
This section should clearly describe the motivation for change, the nature of the amendment, and its intended outcome for Cardanoâ€™s governance system.

---

## Motivation: Why is this CAP necessary?

Explain the purpose of this amendment and the governance problem it seeks to solve. Reference the linked [**Constitution Issue Statement (CIS)**] if applicable.  
Clearly outline which stakeholders are impacted (e.g., dReps, SPOs, Constitutional Committee, governance bodies) and how the amendment improves governance outcomes.

If this CAP modifies or supersedes an existing constitutional article or governance guardrail, explain why that is necessary and what shortcomings it addresses.

---

## Amendment Specification

Provide the **exact text** of the proposed constitutional change or addition. This section is considered the **canonical version** of the amendment once ratified.

Include, where relevant:

- New or amended article text  
- Changes to governance parameters or guardrails  
- Definitions of new governance mechanisms or procedures  
- Versioning scheme, if applicable

---

## Rationale: How does this CAP achieve its goals?

Discuss the reasoning behind the proposed amendment and how it addresses the governance issue described in the CIS. Cover:

- Why this solution was chosen over alternatives  
- Key considerations and trade-offs  
- Outcomes from community discussion and review  
- Backward compatibility or transition considerations (if any)

---

## Path to Ratification

### Acceptance Criteria

Define the conditions under which this amendment becomes **Ratified**. Examples include:

- Minimum vote thresholds and quorum requirements  
- Constitutional Committee certification

Outline the steps required to implement the amendment once ratified. This may include:

- Executing an on-chain governance action  
- Coordinating off-chain steps (e.g., publication, ecosystem communication)  
- Updating relevant tooling, dApps, or governance dashboards
