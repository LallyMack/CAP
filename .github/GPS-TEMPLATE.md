## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the governance or constitutional issue. Explain the governance gap, ambiguity, or problem being highlighted.

## Background
Provide relevant historical, contextual, or procedural information about why this governance problem exists. Mention prior proposals or decisions if relevant.

## Problem
A clear and detailed definition of the governance or constitutional problem. What ambiguity, gap, or systemic issue is being exposed?

## Use Cases
Offer concrete examples from the perspective of stakeholders (delegates, SPOs, dReps, voters, etc.) that illustrate the governance problem in real contexts. Highlight current alternatives and why they fall short.

## Governance Goals
List what an ideal governance solution would aim to achieve. Include any boundaries (non-goals), constraints, or evaluation metrics (e.g., transparency, accountability, scalability).

## Open Questions
List critical governance questions that any future amendment (CAP) should answer. These guide solution design and ensure proposals address the real root causes.

## Proposed Next Steps
(Optional) Suggest possible paths forward — such as drafting a CAP, forming a working group, or further research — without prescribing a solution.
