## Abstract

A short (~200 word) summary of the governance or constitutional issue. Explain the governance gap, ambiguity, or systemic challenge this document highlights and why it matters for Cardano governance.

## Background

Provide relevant historical, contextual, or procedural information explaining **why** this governance problem exists. Mention any prior proposals, constitutional articles, or governance decisions that contribute to or attempt to address this issue.

## Problem Description

A clear and detailed definition of the governance or constitutional problem. What ambiguity, gap, conflict, or systemic issue is being exposed? Clearly state the scope and implications of the problem.

## Use Cases

Offer concrete examples from the perspective of stakeholders (e.g., dReps, SPOs, voters, Constitutional Committee, tooling developers) that illustrate the governance problem in real-world contexts. Highlight existing approaches or workarounds and explain why they are insufficient.

## Governance Goals

List what an ideal solution should aim to achieve. Goals may include principles such as transparency, accountability, legitimacy, scalability, or constitutional integrity.  
Also list **non-goals** or constraints to define the boundaries of acceptable solutions. These goals will later help assess the effectiveness of proposed CAPs.

## Open Questions

List critical governance questions that any future amendment (CAP) should address. These guide solution design and ensure that proposals respond directly to the problem’s root causes.

For example:
- What governance body is responsible for resolving this ambiguity?
- How should conflicts between constitutional articles be resolved?
- What mechanisms would ensure accountability in this area?

## Proposed Next Steps (Optional)

Suggest possible paths forward — such as drafting a CAP, forming a working group, conducting further research, or gathering stakeholder input — without prescribing a specific solution.

## Status

`Open` – The problem is clearly stated but no CAP has solved it yet.  
`Addressed (by CAP-XXXX)` – One or more CAPs have fully addressed the problem.  
`Inactive (reason)` – The problem is withdrawn, obsolete, or invalid.

## References (Optional)

Include links to related governance proposals, constitutional documents, forum discussions, or research papers.

## Acknowledgements (Optional)
