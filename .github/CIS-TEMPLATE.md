## Abstract

A short (~200 word) summary of the **constitutional or governance issue**. Explain the governance gap, ambiguity, or systemic challenge this document highlights and why it matters for Cardano governance.

This section should **define the problem without prescribing a solution**, leaving space for multiple CAPs to address it in different ways.

---

## Background

Provide historical, contextual, or procedural information explaining **why** this constitutional issue exists.  
Mention any prior proposals, constitutional articles, or governance decisions that contributed to or attempted to address this issue.  
This section establishes the context and shows why the issue is relevant now.

---

## Problem

Define the **constitutional or governance problem** clearly and thoroughly.  
What ambiguity, gap, conflict, or systemic issue is being exposed? What are its causes and consequences?  
Describe the scope of the issue and its implications for governance processes, constitutional interpretation, or stakeholder participation.

---

## Impact

Explain how this problem affects governance outcomes, stakeholders, or the Constitution.  
Highlight risks such as reduced legitimacy, stalled decision-making, weakened accountability, or governance capture.  
Where relevant, quantify the impact with examples or data.

---

## Use Cases

Offer concrete examples from the perspective of different stakeholders (e.g., dReps, SPOs, voters, Constitutional Committee, tooling developers) that illustrate the issue in real-world contexts.  
Highlight existing workarounds or approaches and explain why they are insufficient.

---

## Goals

List the **governance or constitutional goals** that any solution to this problem should aim to achieve. Examples include:

- Transparency  
- Accountability  
- Legitimacy  
- Scalability  
- Constitutional integrity  

Also define **non-goals** or constraints — boundaries that solutions should not cross. These goals will guide CAP authors and reviewers in assessing solution quality.

---

## Open Questions

List critical governance questions that future amendments (CAPs) should aim to answer.  
These guide solution design and ensure proposals address the root causes of the problem.

For example:
- Which governance body is responsible for resolving this ambiguity?
- How should conflicts between constitutional articles be resolved?
- What mechanisms would ensure accountability in this area?

---

## Proposed Next Steps (Optional)

Suggest possible paths forward without prescribing a solution.  
These could include drafting a CAP, forming a working group, conducting research, or gathering stakeholder input.

---

## Status

- **Open** – The issue is clearly stated but not yet addressed by any CAP.  
- **Addressed (by CAP-XXXX)** – One or more CAPs have fully resolved the issue.  
- **Inactive (reason)** – The issue is withdrawn, obsolete, or no longer relevant.
