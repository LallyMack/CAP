## 🗒️ Abstract

To improve clarity and beauty in Cardano governance communication,  
this CAP proposes that all official proposals must include **at least one haiku**  
summarizing the amendment’s intent.

> *Three lines, seventeen*  
> *Syllables of pure insight*  
> *Governance refined.*

---

## 🧭 Motivation

Community members struggle to understand lengthy technical amendments.  
Haikus offer concise, emotionally resonant summaries.  
Additionally, poetic expression improves morale and meme potential.

---

## 🧱 Specification

1. Each CAP must include exactly one **approved haiku** in the Abstract section.  
2. Haikus will be reviewed for syllable accuracy by the **Haiku Compliance Committee (HCC)**.  
3. Non-compliant proposals will be returned for “poetic rework.”  
4. Seasonal references are encouraged but optional.

---

## 📜 Rationale

Structured brevity leads to structured thinking.  
Haikus distill the essence of governance, aligning community focus around shared rhythm.  
Also, it’s funny.

---

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

Existing CAPs are grandfathered in, though retroactive poetic translation is recommended.
