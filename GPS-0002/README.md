## Abstract

The Cardano community faces a pressing governance challenge: **burnout**. Stake pool operators forget to sleep, DReps debate for 36 hours straight, and contributors submit PRs that look like they were written by someone hallucinating in a caffeine void. This GPS highlights the urgent need for structured rest, hydration, and coffee.

## Problem

Cardano‚Äôs governance process is designed for humans ‚Äî yet humans are terrible at pacing themselves. Meetings run too long, votes pile up, and GitHub notifications haunt contributors in their dreams. Over time, this leads to exhaustion, mistakes, and (in one documented case) an accidental governance vote to rename ADA ‚ÄúSteve.‚Äù

The absence of **structured breaks** in the governance lifecycle is a systemic flaw. Without a protocol-level solution, the risk of burnout ‚Äî and chaos ‚Äî grows with network participation.

## Use Cases

- A DRep spends 14 hours reading proposals and accidentally delegates all voting power to a test address.
- A developer merges a pull request that replaces every reference to "Cardano" with "Cardonno."
- A stake pool operator dreams of blocks and wakes up screaming ‚ÄúSPO fees!‚Äù at 3 AM.

## Goals

- Reduce community burnout and governance errors.
- Create cultural rituals (like coffee breaks ‚òï) that make governance more enjoyable.
- Encourage lighter, more sustainable participation rhythms.

## Open Questions

- Should tea drinkers be allowed to participate in Coffee Epochs?
- Could on-chain coffee metadata serve future governance analytics?
- Can breaks be algorithmically adjusted based on contributor pulse rate data?
