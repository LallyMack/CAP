## Abstract

The Cardano governance ecosystem faces a persistent human challenge: **burnout**. Stake pool operators forget to sleep, DReps debate for 36 hours straight, and contributors submit PRs that look like they were written by someone hallucinating in a caffeine void.  

This Governance Problem Statement (GPS) highlights the urgent need for **structured rest, hydration, and coffee breaks** within governance workflows. Addressing burnout is critical for ensuring decision quality, contributor well-being, and the long-term sustainability of Cardano governance.

---

## Background

Cardano‚Äôs governance framework was designed for a decentralized, human-led decision-making process. However, the intensity and continuous nature of governance ‚Äî from proposal reviews and debates to on-chain votes ‚Äî place significant demands on contributors.

As participation increases and governance complexity grows, so too does the cognitive and emotional load on stakeholders. Burnout is not just an individual issue; it becomes a systemic governance problem when it leads to **reduced engagement, errors in decision-making, and lower governance quality**.

---

## Problem

Cardano governance depends on humans ‚Äî and humans are notoriously bad at pacing themselves. Meetings stretch on too long, voting queues pile up, and GitHub notifications follow contributors into their dreams. Over time, this leads to exhaustion, mistakes, and, in one documented case, an accidental governance vote to rename ADA **"Steve."**

The **absence of structured breaks** in the governance lifecycle is a fundamental flaw. Without mechanisms to encourage rest and pacing, the governance process risks becoming unsustainable as participation grows ‚Äî threatening both decision quality and contributor retention.

---

## Impact

Unchecked burnout has wide-reaching implications for Cardano governance:

- **Decision Quality Degrades:** Exhausted contributors are more prone to mistakes, oversights, and rash decisions.  
- **Participation Drops:** Burnt-out stakeholders disengage, reducing the diversity and legitimacy of governance decisions.  
- **Community Culture Suffers:** A stressed and exhausted governance community risks toxicity and reduced collaboration.  
- **Ecosystem Sustainability Declines:** Long-term governance effectiveness depends on contributor well-being and retention.

---

## Goals

Solutions addressing this problem should aim to:

- **Reduce Burnout:** Introduce cultural or protocol-level practices that promote rest and pacing.  
- **Improve Decision Quality:** Ensure contributors are engaged, alert, and capable of making thoughtful decisions.  
- **Foster Governance Rituals:** Encourage traditions (like coffee breaks ‚òï) that make governance more enjoyable and sustainable.  
- **Support Human-Centric Governance:** Align governance processes with realistic human capacities and rhythms.

## Use Cases

1. A DRep spends 14 hours reviewing proposals and accidentally delegates all voting power to a test address.  
2. A developer merges a pull request that replaces every instance of ‚ÄúCardano‚Äù with ‚ÄúCardonno.‚Äù  
3. A stake pool operator dreams of blocks and wakes up screaming ‚ÄúSPO fees!‚Äù at 3 AM.

These scenarios, while humorous, illustrate the real governance risks of fatigue and lack of pacing.

## Open Questions

- Should tea drinkers be allowed to participate in **Coffee Epochs**?  
- Could **on-chain coffee metadata** serve future governance analytics?  
- Can break schedules be **algorithmically adjusted** based on contributor engagement or biometric data?

---

## Proposed Next Steps

- Develop and evaluate CAPs proposing structured breaks in governance workflows (e.g., [CAP-0002: Mandatory On-Chain Coffee Breaks](../CAP-0002/README.md)).  
- Research cultural and behavioral interventions that improve pacing in decentralized decision-making.  
- Explore metadata standards to record and analyze governance rest cycles for future optimization.
