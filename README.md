# Cardano Amendment Proposals (CAPs)

A [Cardano Amendment Proposal (CAP)](./CAP-0001) is a formalized amendment document for the Cardano Constitution and the name of the process by which such documents are produced and listed.  
A CAP provides exact text changes or additions to the Constitution and describes the governance rationale behind them.  
In this CAP, we explain what a CAP is; how the CAP process functions; the role of CAP Editors; and how users should go about proposing, discussing, and structuring a CAP.

The intention is for CAPs to be the primary mechanism for proposing constitutional amendments, collecting community input, and recording governance design decisions.  
Because CAPs are text files in a versioned repository, their revision history becomes the historical record of constitutional change.

> [!TIP]  
> For new CAPs, a reference template is available in [.github/workflows/CAP-TEMPLATE.md](.github/workflows/CAP-TEMPLATE.md)

# Governance Problem Statements (GPS)

A [Governance Problem Statement (GPS)](./GPS-0001) is a formalized governance issue documented for the Cardano ecosystem and the name of the process by which such documents are produced and listed.  
GPSs highlight governance gaps, ambiguities, or problems that may lead to one or more CAPs.  
They are meant to live side-by-side with CAPs as first-class citizens in this repository.
