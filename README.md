# Cardano Amendment Proposals (CAPs)

A [Cardano Amendment Proposal (CAP)](./CAP-0001) is a formalized amendment document for the Cardano Constitution and the name of the process by which such documents are produced and listed.  
A CAP provides exact text changes or additions to the Constitution and describes the governance rationale behind them.  
In this CAP, we explain what a CAP is; how the CAP process functions; the role of CAP Editors; and how users should go about proposing, discussing, and structuring a CAP.

The intention is for CAPs to be the primary mechanism for proposing constitutional amendments, collecting community input, and recording governance design decisions.  
Because CAPs are text files in a versioned repository, their revision history becomes the historical record of constitutional change.

> [!TIP]  
> For new CAPs, a reference template is available in [.github/CAP-TEMPLATE.md](.github/CAP-TEMPLATE.md)
