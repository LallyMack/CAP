## 📚 Problem Statement

Cardano’s governance documents have become excessively verbose,  
often containing more adjectives than actionable content.  
Some proposals begin with poetry unintentionally — and not the good kind.

---

## 🔍 Context and Impact

Long proposals slow down reviews, cause TL;DR fatigue,  
and increase the probability of readers skipping directly to the memes.

This issue directly impacts:
- Proposal clarity  
- Community engagement  
- Governance meme velocity (GMV)

## 💡 Potential Solutions

1. **CAP-0003 — Mandatory Governance Haiku Standardization**  
   Enforces concise, rhythmic communication standards.  
2. Word-count caps for abstracts (500 words max).  
3. Automatic buzzword filters (“synergy”, “holistic”, “epochal alignment”).

## 🧭 Open Questions

- Should haiku translations be multilingual?  
- What happens if a haiku accidentally becomes too profound?  
- Should there be limerick exceptions for testnets?
