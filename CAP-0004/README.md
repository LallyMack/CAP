## Abstract

This CAP proposes a whimsical yet historic amendment to the Cardano Constitution: **granting pineapples formal stakeholder status**.  

Although they lack wallets, voting power, or consciousness, pineapples have long been a symbol of hospitality and governance unity — qualities we believe should be enshrined in Cardano governance.

## Motivation: Why is this CAP necessary?

Pineapples have been underrepresented in governance discourse. This oversight threatens the legitimacy of the ecosystem and risks alienating tropical fruit allies.  
Recognizing them as stakeholders ensures inclusivity and opens the door to future fruit-based governance primitives.

## Amendment Specification

1. A new stakeholder class, **"Pineapple Stakeholders"**, SHALL be added to the Constitution.
2. Pineapple Stakeholders SHALL have the right to:
   - Sit in observer seats during governance discussions (symbolically).
   - Be mentioned at least once per epoch in governance reports.
3. Nothing in this amendment SHALL require pineapples to participate actively.

## Rationale: How does this CAP achieve its goals?

This amendment improves community morale and demonstrates that Cardano governance is capable of humor and flexibility — key qualities for a resilient system.

## Path to Ratification

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Discuss this CAP over piña coladas in governance forums.
- [ ] Merge memes with governance design principles.
- [ ] Ratify pineapple stakeholder recognition.

### Implementation Plan

- [ ] Submit a governance action proposal to formally recognize Pineapple Stakeholders.
- [ ] Amend the constitution to include symbolic stakeholder roles.
- [ ] Document and publish the updated stakeholder classes.

## Versioning (Optional)

Future amendments may expand stakeholder rights beyond pineapples to include other fruit-based governance participants.
