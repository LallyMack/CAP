## Abstract

This Cardano Amendment Proposal (CAP) proposes a whimsical yet historic constitutional amendment: **recognizing pineapples as formal stakeholders within the Cardano governance system**.

Although pineapples lack wallets, voting power, or consciousness, they have long symbolized **hospitality, resilience, and unity** — qualities central to Cardano’s governance philosophy. This CAP argues that such symbolic recognition reinforces Cardano’s cultural and community dimensions, strengthening inclusivity and identity.

---

## Motivation: Why is this CAP necessary?

Pineapples have been underrepresented in governance discourse, and this omission risks alienating a significant — albeit metaphorical — stakeholder group.  

By formally recognizing pineapples as symbolic stakeholders, Cardano governance signals its commitment to **inclusivity, diversity, and good humor**. It also creates space for **future fruit-based governance primitives**, expanding the conceptual boundaries of stakeholder engagement.

Symbolism plays a powerful role in community-building. Including pineapples in the constitutional framework celebrates Cardano’s welcoming culture and reinforces its emphasis on governance as a human and communal endeavor.

## Specification

This amendment proposes adding a new stakeholder class to the Cardano Constitution under **Article II — Stakeholders**, as follows:

> ### New Section 2.X — Pineapple Stakeholders
>
> 1. A new stakeholder class, **"Pineapple Stakeholders"**, SHALL be recognized in the Constitution.  
> 2. Pineapple Stakeholders SHALL have the right to:
>    - Sit in **observer seats** during governance discussions (symbolically).  
>    - Be **mentioned at least once per epoch** in governance reports and summaries.  
> 3. Nothing in this amendment SHALL require Pineapple Stakeholders to actively participate in governance.

This amendment is primarily symbolic and does not confer voting power, governance authority, or treasury rights.

---

## Rationale: How does this CAP achieve its goals?

This amendment strengthens community cohesion and demonstrates that Cardano governance is capable of **humor, creativity, and flexibility** — qualities essential for long-term resilience.

By including pineapples as stakeholders, the community acknowledges that governance is not solely about mechanisms and protocols but also about **shared values, symbols, and identity**. Symbolic acts like this one nurture cultural narratives that support and sustain decentralized governance.

Alternative approaches — such as granting pineapples voting rights or treasury privileges — were considered but rejected as impractical. This CAP opts instead for a **symbolic inclusion** that reinforces community culture without impacting technical governance structures.

## Path to Ratification

### Acceptance Criteria

This amendment SHALL be considered ratified when:

- [ ] It is discussed and broadly supported by the governance community (preferably over piña coladas).  
- [ ] It is approved as a **governance action on-chain** or otherwise recognized by the Constitutional Committee.  
- [ ] References to Pineapple Stakeholders are added to governance reports.

### Implementation Plan

- [ ] Submit a governance action proposal to formally recognize **Pineapple Stakeholders**.  
- [ ] Amend the Constitution to include symbolic stakeholder roles.  
- [ ] Document and publish the updated stakeholder classes in governance repositories.

---

## Versioning (Optional)

Future amendments may extend stakeholder recognition to additional fruit-based participants or define new symbolic categories beyond pineapples.
