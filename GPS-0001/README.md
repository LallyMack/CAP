## Abstract

On-chain governance is central to Cardano’s constitutional model. However, **participation in governance actions and constitutional processes remains consistently low** across key stakeholder groups — particularly ADA holders and delegated representatives (dReps).  

This Governance Problem Statement (GPS) explores the systemic causes and consequences of low participation and representation, the governance risks it poses, and provides a foundation for future **Cardano Amendment Proposals (CAPs)** aimed at improving engagement, representation, and legitimacy in governance.

---

## Background

Cardano’s governance framework empowers all stakeholders — ADA holders, stake pool operators (SPOs), delegated representatives (dReps), and the Constitutional Committee — to participate in decentralized decision-making.  
Yet, governance actions since the introduction of **Voltaire** have shown **participation rates far below expectations**:

- Fewer than **8%** of ADA wallets have voted in major governance actions.
- Many registered dReps remain inactive or vote inconsistently.
- SPO participation is uneven and concentrated among a small subset of pools.

This persistent underrepresentation risks undermining the democratic legitimacy and decentralization of Cardano governance, raising concerns about inclusivity, accountability, and resilience.

---

## Problem

Low participation in on-chain governance threatens the foundational principle of Cardano’s constitutional model: **rule by the community**.  
Without broad stakeholder engagement, several systemic governance issues emerge:

- **Legitimacy Concerns:** Decisions made by a small minority may not reflect the will of the broader community.  
- **Centralization Risk:** Governance influence concentrates among a small number of actors (e.g., large dReps or SPOs).  
- **Stagnation:** Governance actions may fail to meet quorum thresholds, blocking necessary constitutional changes or parameter updates.  
- **Reduced Accountability:** Low participation weakens community oversight of governance actors and decisions.

The current Constitution assumes active participation but lacks mechanisms to **encourage, incentivize, or enforce** it.

---

## Impact

Low participation undermines:

- **Governance Legitimacy:** Constitutional changes may lack broad social consent.  
- **System Resilience:** Low engagement increases the risk of governance capture by a few actors.  
- **Constitutional Evolution:** Quorum failures slow governance progress and block necessary amendments.  
- **Community Trust:** Perceived exclusion reduces confidence in Cardano’s governance system.

---

## Goals

Future amendments and governance actions that address this problem should aim to:

- **Increase Participation:** Encourage broader engagement from ADA holders, SPOs, and dReps in all governance actions.  
- **Improve Representation:** Ensure decision-making power reflects stake distribution and community sentiment.  
- **Enhance Transparency:** Provide visibility into participation metrics and dRep activity.  
- **Create Incentives:** Explore economic or reputational incentives for active participation.  
- **Preserve Voluntarism:** Respect stakeholder autonomy and avoid coercive mechanisms.

**Non-Goals:**

- Replacing or bypassing existing governance actors.  
- Mandating participation through punitive measures.

---

## Open Questions

- What participation threshold should define legitimacy for constitutional changes?  
- Should dReps be required to meet a minimum voting activity level to retain their status?  
- What incentives (on-chain rewards, reputational systems, delegation boosts) could drive meaningful engagement?  
- How can participation data be surfaced transparently to ADA holders without compromising privacy?  
- Should quorum rules adapt dynamically based on participation levels?

---

## Use Cases

1. **Governance Actions Without Quorum:** A treasury allocation proposal fails despite strong support due to insufficient voter turnout.  
2. **Inactive dReps:** Delegators unknowingly delegate voting power to inactive dReps, leaving their stake unrepresented.  
3. **Centralized Influence:** A handful of dReps consistently shape governance outcomes due to widespread non-participation.  
4. **Blocked Amendments:** Constitutional amendments cannot proceed because quorum requirements are not met, even with broad support among those who do participate.

These scenarios demonstrate that low participation is not a theoretical concern — it directly impacts governance functionality and decision quality.

---

## Proposed Next Steps

- Explore a CAP introducing **minimum activity standards for dReps** to retain delegation privileges.  
- Research and propose **incentive models** for active governance participation.  
- Develop **transparency tools and dashboards** to track voter turnout and dRep performance.  
- Consider **graduated quorum thresholds** that adapt to participation trends while preserving legitimacy.
