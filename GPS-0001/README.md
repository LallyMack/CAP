## Abstract

On-chain governance is central to Cardano’s constitutional model, yet participation in governance votes and constitutional processes remains consistently low across key stakeholder groups — particularly ADA holders and delegated representatives (dReps).  
This Governance Problem Statement explores the systemic causes and consequences of low participation and representation, highlighting the governance risks it poses and guiding the design of future Constitutional Amendment Proposals (CAPs) aimed at improving engagement and legitimacy.

## Background

Cardano’s governance system was designed to empower all stakeholders — ADA holders, stake pool operators (SPOs), delegated representatives (dReps), and the Constitutional Committee — to participate in decentralized decision-making.

However, governance actions since the introduction of Voltaire have consistently shown participation well below expectations:

- Fewer than 8% of ADA wallets have voted in major governance actions.
- Many registered dReps remain inactive or fail to vote consistently.
- SPO participation is uneven and concentrated among a small subset of pools.

This persistent underrepresentation risks undermining the democratic legitimacy and decentralization of Cardano’s governance.

## Problem

Low participation in governance threatens the foundational principle of Cardano’s constitutional model: **rule by the community**.  
The absence of broad stakeholder engagement leads to several systemic issues:

- **Legitimacy Concerns:** Decisions made by a small minority may not reflect the will of the broader ecosystem.
- **Centralization Risk:** Active governance influence concentrates among a small number of actors (e.g., large dReps or SPOs).
- **Stagnation:** Governance actions may fail to meet quorum thresholds, blocking necessary constitutional changes or parameter updates.
- **Reduced Accountability:** With low engagement, there’s limited community oversight of governance actors or decisions.

While the Constitution assumes active participation as a default behavior, it lacks mechanisms to **encourage, incentivize, or enforce** participation.

## Use Cases

1. **Governance Actions Without Quorum:** A treasury allocation proposal fails despite strong support due to insufficient voter turnout.
2. **Inactive dReps:** Delegators unknowingly delegate voting power to dReps who never cast votes, leaving their stake effectively unrepresented.
3. **Centralized Influence:** A handful of dReps consistently shape governance outcomes due to widespread non-participation.
4. **Constitutional Amendments Stalled:** Important amendments cannot proceed because quorum requirements are not met, even when the majority of participants support them.

These examples illustrate that low participation is not just a theoretical concern — it directly impacts governance functionality and decision quality.

## Governance Goals

Future amendments and governance actions addressing this issue should aim to:

- **Increase Participation:** Encourage broader engagement from ADA holders, SPOs, and dReps in all governance actions.
- **Improve Representation:** Ensure that the distribution of decision-making power reflects the distribution of stake and community sentiment.
- **Enhance Transparency:** Provide better visibility into participation metrics and dRep activity.
- **Create Incentives:** Explore economic or reputational incentives for active governance participation.
- **Preserve Voluntary Governance:** Solutions should respect stakeholder autonomy and avoid coercive mechanisms.

Non-goals:
- Replacing or bypassing existing governance actors.
- Mandating participation through punitive measures.

## Open Questions

- What participation threshold should be considered sufficient for legitimacy in constitutional changes?
- Should dReps be required to meet a minimum voting activity to retain their status?
- What forms of incentives (on-chain rewards, reputational scores, delegation boosts) could drive meaningful engagement?
- How can participation data be surfaced transparently to ADA holders without compromising privacy?
- Should quorum rules adapt dynamically based on participation levels?

## Proposed Next Steps

- Explore a CAP introducing **minimum activity standards for dReps** to retain delegation privileges.
- Research and propose incentive models for **active governance participation**.
- Develop tools and dashboards to **increase transparency** of voter turnout and dRep performance.
- Consider **graduated quorum thresholds** based on participation trends to improve governance efficiency without compromising legitimacy.
