Abstract
This amendment proposes the introduction of mandatory training and orientation for all newly appointed members of the Constitutional Committee (CC).
The purpose is to ensure that each CC member begins their term with a consistent understanding of the Cardano Constitution, governance framework, decision-making protocols, and ethical standards required for effective service.

By formalising this onboarding requirement, the amendment aims to strengthen the CC’s collective capability, reduce early-term uncertainty, and uphold consistency and accountability across successive committees.
This measure enhances governance reliability, transparency, and institutional continuity within Cardano’s constitutional ecosystem.

Motivation: Why is this CAP necessary?
Currently, there is no formal constitutional requirement for orientation or training of newly appointed Constitutional Committee members.
As a result, newly elected entities or individuals may experience knowledge gaps regarding governance procedures, operational expectations, or interpretation of constitutional duties—particularly given the complexity of Cardano’s on-chain and off-chain governance mechanisms.

This lack of consistency can lead to inefficiencies, procedural delays, or uneven application of constitutional principles across terms.

The amendment seeks to address these issues by:

Ensuring baseline competence and shared understanding among all CC members at the start of each term;

Promoting continuity of constitutional interpretation between committees;

Enhancing transparency and accountability through clear expectations of readiness before members undertake governance actions.

Stakeholders impacted include the Constitutional Committee, DReps, SPOs, and the wider Cardano community, who rely on a competent and aligned CC to uphold the Constitution faithfully and efficiently.

Amendment Specification
New Article Addition
The following text shall be inserted into Article VIII – The Constitutional Committee, as a new subsection:

Clause 8.6 – Mandatory Orientation and Training

(a) Each newly appointed member or entity of the Constitutional Committee shall, prior to exercising constitutional duties, complete a mandatory orientation and training program approved by Intersect or its designated governance education partner.

(b) The training shall include, at minimum:

An overview of the Cardano Constitution, its principles, and amendment processes;

A review of governance roles, including those of DReps, SPOs, and other constitutional bodies;

Ethical standards, conflict of interest guidelines, and transparency requirements;

Operational and procedural guidance for decision-making, quorum, and certification.

(c) Completion of training shall be recorded and published in the governance record prior to the member’s first certification or governance action.

(d) Returning members who have completed the program within the preceding 18 months may be exempt at the discretion of the governance oversight body.

Rationale: How does this CAP achieve its goals?
This amendment ensures that every Constitutional Committee begins its mandate from a shared baseline of knowledge, ethics, and procedural competence, strengthening governance legitimacy and consistency.

Alternative approaches—such as voluntary training—were considered but found insufficient, as participation cannot be guaranteed.
Mandatory orientation guarantees that all members, regardless of prior experience or background, are equipped to interpret and apply the Constitution responsibly.

Community discussions within governance working groups have highlighted a recurring theme: institutional memory and knowledge transfer are essential for the stability and credibility of Cardano’s governance institutions.
Formalizing this process supports continuity and lowers risk during transitions between committees.

There are no backward compatibility issues, as the amendment applies only to future CC appointments following ratification.

Path to Ratification
Acceptance Criteria
Ratification by on-chain governance vote in accordance with Article VI.

Certification by the current Constitutional Committee confirming the amendment does not conflict with existing constitutional guardrails.

Simple majority of voting power in favour, with quorum met according to constitutional thresholds.

Implementation Plan
Update the canonical constitution file (constitution/constitution-v2.txt) to include Clause 8.6.

Develop or designate an approved training and orientation program, in collaboration with the Governance Education Working Group or equivalent.

Integrate confirmation of training completion into governance dashboards and CC onboarding records.

Publicly communicate the new requirement through Intersect’s governance documentation and member briefings.

Versioning (Optional)
If governance structures evolve to include new constitutional bodies, the training clause may be extended by a future CAP to include equivalent orientation for other constitutional or governance institutions.
